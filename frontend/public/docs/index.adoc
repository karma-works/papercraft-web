Welcome to the Papercraft Web documentation. This tool allows you to unwrap 3D models into printable papercraft patterns.

== UI Features

=== Join Edges
The **Join Edges** tool (keyboard shortcut: `J`) allows you to merge two separate edges that belong to the same original 3D mesh edge. This is useful for reducing the number of pieces in your papercraft.

=== Cut Edge
The **Cut Edge** tool (keyboard shortcut: `C`) allows you to split a single piece into two along an edge. This helps in unfolding complex shapes that cannot be flattened without additional cuts.

=== Toggle Flaps ("F" Button)
The **Toggle Flaps** button (keyboard shortcut: `F`) toggles the visibility of glue flaps in the 2D view. Glue flaps are the extra tabs used to glue pieces together.

== Getting Started

To get started, simply load a 3D model (OBJ, STL, or PDO) using the **Load Model** button.
